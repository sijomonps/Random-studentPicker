A **simple, fun, and beautifully animated** web application to randomly select a student from our class.  
No more boring number generators!

## 🌟 Why I Built This  

In our class, we often use random number pickers to select someone for a presentation, assign a task, or volunteer for an activity.  
While functional, it always felt a bit impersonal and—let’s be honest—a little boring.  

I thought, **why not create something specifically for our batch?**  
A tool that knows our names and adds a little bit of fun and drama to the selection process.  

This project is the result of that idea.  
It’s a customized website where we can pick names directly, making the process feel more connected to our class.  

I built this using **AI tools** to help with the coding and design, turning a simple idea into a fully functional and aesthetic webpage for all of us to use.
