🚀 Why I Built This
In our class, we often use random number pickers to select someone for a presentation, assign a task, or volunteer for an activity. While functional, it always felt a bit impersonal and, let's be honest, a little boring.

I thought, why not create something specifically for our batch? A tool that knows our names and adds a little bit of fun and drama to the selection process. This project is the result of that idea. It's a customized website where we can pick names directly, making the process feel more connected to our class.

I built this using AI tools to help with the coding and design, turning a simple idea into a fully functional and aesthetic webpage for all of us to use.

✨ Features

⚡ Quick Mode: For when you're in a hurry! A toggle to speed up the animations and get a name instantly.

🎨 Sleek & Minimalist UI: A clean, modern, and aesthetic design that is easy to use.
